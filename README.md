# CMS

Automated CMS tasks with many one click functions that interact with HTML elements on the page and save 80-90% of time for most tasks.

- Certain tasks are bundled in one click buttons that operate on multiple tabs in the chromedriver Chrome application that spawns with the package
- The app reads excel file(s) to understand the mapping of certain features such as users, banks, action items and texts to fill in
- Various functionalities are customized for different users based on how their page HTML elements are laid out and also based on the requirements after speaking with many users
- Advanced error handling capabilities and narrator in-built for a better warning monitoring system

##Recent Updates:

- Added Dash to Excel Button - will create an excel with name as timestamp so that every time there is a new file and older one is not overwritten. It takes around 40 seconds to generate the data as the conversion from html to list to excel takes some time. 

- Added 'TWM' button (Tab Wise Maintainable)- it is used to make mass complaints maintainable which are opened in multiple tabs (first tab being reserved for home page).

- Added SBI Delhi & Kanpur separate TWM functions (in cyan color)

- Added BO mass update complaints as BO Decision with comments that will be picked up from the related field in the MASTER.xlsx

- Modification for Kanpur - Only NO Record Change while executing TWM functions (in cyan color)

Enjoy!
